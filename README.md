📊 Excited to share my latest project on Foodie-Fi Customer Analysis! 🔍

I have used SQL for deep insights into customer behaviors and subscription trends, and I’ve explored key metrics to uncover valuable business insights from Foodie-Fi's data.


💻 Technical Tools Used:

- SQL Operations: Complex queries involving JOINs, CTEs, aggregate functions, and window functions to analyze subscription data.


🔍 Key Objectives:

🔺 Determine the total number of unique customers.

🔺 Analyze the monthly distribution of trial plan start dates.

🔺 Identify plan start dates post-2020.

🔺 Calculate customer churn rates.

🔺 Measure the churn rate immediately after the trial period.

🔺 Evaluate customer plans post-trial.

🔺 Breakdown of active plans at the end of 2020.

🔺 Count annual plan upgrades in 2020.

🔺 Calculate average days to upgrade to an annual plan.

🔺 Segment average upgrade time into 30-day periods.

🔺 Identify downgrades from pro monthly to basic monthly plans.



🔍 Key Findings:

🔺 Total Customers: 1000 unique customers.

🔺 Monthly Trial Distribution: January had the highest trial starts (88), and February had the lowest (68).
